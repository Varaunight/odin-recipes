    <h1>Red Lentil Curry</h1>
    <img src="../images/lentils.jpg" alt="Lentils on the Right">
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This red lentil curry is rich and hearty. It's great as a main meal rather than a side dish like the more traditional Indian dhal. 
        Don't let the ingredient list faze you â€” this is an easy dish to make. This dish is excellent served with basmati rice.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cup lentils</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons curry paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash lentils in cold water until water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Put lentils in a pot with enough water to cover; bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer, adding water as needed to keep lentils covered, until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions in hot oil until caramelized, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix all the spices and cook for 1 to 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato puree and lentils; cook until warmed through.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
